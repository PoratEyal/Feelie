## What is Feeli?

Feeli is an AAC (Augmentative and Alternative Communication) app designed for Hebrew speakers who have difficulty speaking or prefer to communicate visually. Instead of typing or writing, users tap on emoji cards—and the app speaks the word or phrase aloud in Hebrew.

## Who is it for?

## Why Feeli?

Communication is a basic human need. When speaking is hard, people can feel isolated or frustrated. Feeli aims to give a voice to those who struggle to use their own—through familiar emojis, clear categories, and natural Hebrew speech.

## How it works

1. **Browse categories** — Home, Emotions, Needs, Body/Pain, Regulation, Social, Activities, Time, Family, Food & Drink
2. **Tap a card** — Each emoji represents a word or phrase. One tap speaks it aloud in Hebrew
3. **Add your own words** — Type any word or phrase; the app suggests an emoji and saves it to your personal list
4. **Choose a voice** — Select a male or female Hebrew voice that feels right for you
